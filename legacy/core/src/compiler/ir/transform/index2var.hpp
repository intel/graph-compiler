/**
 * Replace indexing on tensors with vars. "Cache" the values from/to tensors to
 * local variables. At the end of the scope (stmts node), the cached vars will
 * be written back to the tensors
 * @note This pass should run after function inlining pass
 * Currently this pass is very conservative. A tensor has only one "cache slot".
 * It will "flush" the var back to tensor if
 * 1. In the current/parent scopes, there are more than one different index on
 * the same tensor. e.g. if there is A[i] and then A[j] in use, we don't know if
 * A[i] and A[j] points to the same address, so we cannot cache both of them,
 * and need to "flush" the var for A[i] back to A[i]. However, if A[i] is the
 * only outstanding use of tensor A, we can use A[i] mutiple times and cache it
 * in a var. If `i` is changed between to uses of A[i], we also need to flush it
 * 2. There is a tensorptr on the tensor, the "cached" value of the tensor be
 * "flushed"
 * 3. The tensor is passed to a function call
 * 4. The lifetime of the cached var is over at the end of the scope
 * 5. There is a write to a tensor which is cached in parent scope
