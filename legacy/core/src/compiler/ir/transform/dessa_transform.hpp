/**
 * Converts the IR from SSA (Single-Static-Assignment) form to normal IR for
 * codegen. It mainly does two things:
 * 1. Move the var define nodes to an appropriate scope which covers all uses.
 * Reason: in SSA form, we allow a variable to live across the scopes. e.g. a
 * var can be defined in "then" block of if-else and be used after if-else ends.
 * We need to move the def of the var to a parent scope to make the IR valid. We
 * also need to take the PHI node's inputs into consideration when selecting
 * where to put the definition
 * 2. Resolve PHI nodes. There are two kinds of PHI nodes, which are 1) PHI in
 * for-loops which depends on the value of a var of the previous iteration 2)
 * PHI unrelated with loops. If all/none of the PHI node inputs depend on the
 * values defined in the current for-loop, the PHI is of kind 1), otherwise it
 * is of kind 2). For kind 1), we need a "shadow" copy for the var in the loop
 * to solve the problems like "lost copy" or "swap problem". For kind 2), we
 * just need to add an assign node for each of the inputs of PHI
