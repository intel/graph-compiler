 * @class xbyak_jit_generator
 *
 * \brief Provides JIT translation services during translation, and owns
 * the memory containing the resulting code and data.
 *
 * The class ::xbyak::CodeGenerator provides two distinct services, which
 * (ideally) we'd prefer to keep separate:
 *
 * 1) ownership of the memory in which the JIT'ed code and data reside, and
 *
 * 2) methods and member variables that are used <i>during</i> JIT translation
 *    and are irrelevant once translation is complete.
 *
 * This class extends ::Xbyak::CodeGenerator, and so we're stuck
 * with this class also serving both of those roles.
 *
 * Once the act of JIT translation is complete, the most of the class members
 * that this class inherets from its ancestor classes are no longer relevant.
